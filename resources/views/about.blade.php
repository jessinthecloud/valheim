            This site uses the item and recipe data extracted directly from the game, thanks to a modified version of JotunnDoc, from <x-general.link  rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://github.com/Valheim-Modding/Jotunn">JÃ¶tunn, the Valheim Library</x-general.link>, that I created using their excellent mod tools and tutorials.

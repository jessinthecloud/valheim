<h1 class="w-full text-4xl mb-4">Welcome to Valheim Recipes</h1>

<p class="my-2">
    We're under construction, but you can still use the search box or menu to find the Valheim recipe that you need.

    This site uses the item and recipes data extracted directly from the game, thanks to a modified version of JotunnDoc from <a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://github.com/Valheim-Modding/Jotunn">JÃ¶tunn, the Valheim Library</a> that I created using their excellent mod tools and tutorials.
